//    An event
//
//    - may happen (i.e., triggered is False),
//    - is going to happen (i.e., triggered True) or
//    - has happened (i.e., processed True).
//
// Every event is bound to an environment (env) and is initially not triggered.
// Events are scheduled for processing by the environment after they are
// triggered by either `succeed`, `fail` or `trigger`. These methods also set
// the `ok` flag and the value of the event.
//
// An event has a list of `callbacks`. Once an event gets processed, all
// callbacks will be called with the event as the single argument. Callbacks
// can check if the event was successful by examining `ok` and do further
// processing with the value it has produced.
//
// TODO: Talk about how events are finalized/defused (?) after being processed.
