# simgo
simgo is a discrete-event simulation framework based on simpy

## TODO
 * Shared Resources (i.e., resources, containers, and stores)
 * Documentation (For now, see [simgo examples](https://github.com/bgmerrell/simgo/tree/master/examples) and [simpy documentation](https://simpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/))
 * simpy vs. simgo benchmarks
